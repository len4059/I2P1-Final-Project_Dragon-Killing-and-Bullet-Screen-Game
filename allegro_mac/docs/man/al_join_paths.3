.SH SYNOPSIS

bool al_join_paths(ALLEGRO_PATH *path, const ALLEGRO_PATH *tail)
\f[R]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Concatenate two path structures.
The first path structure is modified.
If `tail' is an absolute path, this function does nothing.
.PP
If `tail' is a relative path, all of its directory components will be
appended to `path'.
tail\[cq]s filename will also overwrite path\[cq]s filename, even if it
is just the empty string.
.PP
Tail\[cq]s drive is ignored.
.PP
Returns true if `tail' was a relative path and so concatenated to
`path', otherwise returns false.
