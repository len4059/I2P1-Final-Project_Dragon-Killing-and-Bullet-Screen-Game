.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include <allegro5/allegro.h>

uint32_t al_get_allegro_version(void)
\f[R]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Returns the (compiled) version of the Allegro library, packed into a
single integer as groups of 8 bits in the form
\f[C](major << 24) | (minor << 16) | (revision << 8) | release\f[R].
.PP
You can use code like this to extract them:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
uint32_t version = al_get_allegro_version();
int major = version >> 24;
int minor = (version >> 16) & 255;
int revision = (version >> 8) & 255;
int release = version & 255;
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The \f[C]release\f[R] number is 0 for an unofficial version and 1 or
greater for an official release.
For example \[lq]5.0.2[1]\[rq] would be the (first) official 5.0.2
release while \[lq]5.0.2[0]\[rq] would be a compile of a version from
the \[lq]5.0.2\[rq] branch before the official release.
