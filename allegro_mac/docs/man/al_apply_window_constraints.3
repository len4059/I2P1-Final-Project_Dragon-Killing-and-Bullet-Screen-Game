.PP
Enable or disable previously set constraints by
al_set_window_constraints(3) function.
.PP
If enabled, the specified display will be automatically resized to new
sizes to conform constraints in next cases:
.IP \[bu] 2
The specified display is resizable, not maximized and is not in
fullscreen mode.
.IP \[bu] 2
If the appropriate current display size (width or height) is less than
the value of constraint.
Applied to minimum constraints.
.IP \[bu] 2
If the appropriate current display size (width or height) is greater
than the value of constraint.
Applied to maximum constraints.
.PP
Constrains are not applied when a display is toggle from windowed to
maximized or fullscreen modes.
When a display is toggle from maximized/fullscreen to windowed mode,
then the display may be resized as described above.
The later case is also possible when a user drags the maximized display
via mouse.
.PP
If disabled, the specified display will stop using constraints.
