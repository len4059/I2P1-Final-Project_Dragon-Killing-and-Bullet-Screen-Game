.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Make a temporary randomly named file given a filename `template'.
.PP
`template' is a string giving the format of the generated filename and
should include one or more capital Xs.
The Xs are replaced with random alphanumeric characters, produced using
a simple pseudo-random number generator only.
There should be no path separators.
.PP
If `ret_path' is not NULL, the address it points to will be set to point
to a new path structure with the name of the temporary file.
.PP
Returns the opened ALLEGRO_FILE(3) on success, NULL on failure.
