.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Loads an image from an ALLEGRO_FILE(3) stream into a new
ALLEGRO_BITMAP(3).
The file type is determined by the passed `ident' parameter, which is a
file name extension including the leading dot.
If (and only if) `ident' is NULL, the file type is determined with
al_identify_bitmap_f(3) instead.
.PP
The flags parameter is the same as for al_load_bitmap_flags(3).
.PP
Returns NULL on error.
The file remains open afterwards.

\f[I]Note:\f[R] the core Allegro library does not support any image file
formats by default.
You must use the allegro_image addon, or register your own format
handler.
