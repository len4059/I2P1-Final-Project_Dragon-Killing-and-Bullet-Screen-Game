al_get_fs_entry_name - Allegro 5 API
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include <allegro5/allegro.h>

const char *al_get_fs_entry_name(ALLEGRO_FS_ENTRY *e)
\f[R]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Returns the entry\[cq]s filename path.
Note that the filesystem encoding may not be known and the conversion to
UTF-8 could in very rare cases cause this to return an invalid path.
Therefore it\[cq]s always safest to access the file over its
ALLEGRO_FS_ENTRY(3) and not the path.
.PP
On success returns a read only string which you must not modify or
destroy.
Returns NULL on failure.
.RS
.PP
Note: prior to 5.1.5 it was written: \[lq]\&... the path will not be an
absolute path if the entry wasn\[cq]t created from an absolute
path\[rq].
This is no longer true.
